## 11/1/2025 - Designed and started working on my Keyboard  

I designed CustomKeyboard V1, a 65% mechanical keyboard for Hack Club Blueprint. The design takes inspiration from Apple's minimalist aesthetic, featuring clean lines, a space gray aluminum case, and a Mac-optimized layout with Command and Option keys. The keyboard uses an ATmega32U4 microcontroller, O-ring gasket mounting, USB-C connectivity, and hot-swap sockets. It runs QMK firmware with VIA support for easy customization. Initially planned as a PCB-based design, I've decided to build the first prototype using hand-wiring techniques with a Pro Micro to validate the layout and gain assembly experience before moving to custom PCB manufacturing.

For now this is what the design will be based on (hopefully)

## 11/2/2025 - Keyboard Plate  

I started by designing a custom layout on keyboard-layout-editor.com, aiming for a compact 65% Mac-compatible setup. After finalizing the layout, I rendered it using kle-render.herokuapp.com  to visualize spacing and proportions.
Next, I used builder.swillkb.com  to generate the plate file. I adjusted stabilizer cutouts and margins, then exported the DXF file.
In Fusion 360, I imported the DXF, extruded the plate to 1.5mm, and added fillets to the corners. I verified switch cutouts and saved the model.
I wrapped up by prepping for case design—measuring the plate, sketching a rough outline, and deciding on mounting style. Case modeling comes next.![CustomKeyboardRender](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzcwNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2dc1653cb792f5b043ba65f4907eefb8cd57536a/CustomKeyboardRender.png)
