## 11/1/2025 - Designed and started working on my Keyboard  

I designed CustomKeyboard V1, a 65% mechanical keyboard. The design takes inspiration from Apple's minimalist aesthetic, featuring clean lines, a space gray aluminum case, and a Mac-optimized layout with Command and Option keys. The keyboard uses an ATmega32U4 microcontroller, O-ring gasket mounting, USB-C connectivity, and hot-swap sockets. It runs QMK firmware with VIA support for easy customization. Currently working on the schematic design phase, with PCB layout and case modeling to follow.

For now this is what the design will be based on (hopefully)
